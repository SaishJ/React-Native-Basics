### Components

- View

  > Used for building a UI. View is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. View maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

- SafeAreaView
  > SafeAreaView renders nested content and automatically applies padding to reflect the portion of the view that is not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestor views.
